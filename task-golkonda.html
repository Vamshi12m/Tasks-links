<h1><u>GOLCONDA</u></h1>

<p>Golconda is a fortified citadel and ruined city located in the western outskirts of <ins><b> Hyderabad, Telangana, India.</b></ins> The fort was originally built by Kakatiya ruler <mark>Pratāparudra</mark> in the 11th century out of mud walls.<sub>[3]</sub> It was ceded to the Bahmani Kings from Musunuri Nayakas during the reign of the Bahmani Sultan Mohammed Shah I, during the first Bahmani-Vijayanagar War. Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as the Governor of Hyderabad by the Bahmani Kings, fortified city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds. Golconda fort is currently abandoned and in ruins. The complex was put by <mark>UNESCO</mark> on its "tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site in <b>2014</b>, with others in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number of different sultanates).<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<h1><u>HISTORY</u> </h1>
<p>The origins of the Golconda fort can be traced back to the <strong> 11th century</strong>. It was originally a small mud fort built by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire.<sup>[3] </sup>The name Golconda is thought to originate from Telugu for "Cowherd's hill" (గొల్ల కొండ, romanized: Gullakōnḍa).<sub>[4][5] </sub>It is also thought that Kakatiya ruler<mark> Ganapatideva </mark><b>1199–1262</b> built a stone hilltop outpost — later known as Golconda fort — to defend their western region. The fort was later developed into a fortified citadel in<b> 1518 </b>by Sultan Quli of the Qutb Shahi Empire and the city was declared the capital of the <u>Golconda Sultanate.</u><sub>[5]</sub></p>

<p>The <i>Bahmani kings</i> took possession of the fort after it was made over to them by means of a sanad by the Rajah of Warangal.[3] Under the Bahmani Sultanate, Golconda slowly rose to prominence. Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (r. 1487–1543), sent by the Bahmanids as a governor at Golconda, established the city as the seat of his governance around 1501. Bahmani rule gradually weakened during this period, and<mark> Sultan Quli</mark> (Quli Qutub Shah period) formally became independent in<u><b> 1518</b></u>, establishing the Qutb Shahi dynasty based in Golconda.[7][8][9] Over a period of <i>62 years,</i> the mud fort was expanded by the first three<b> Qutb Shahi sultans</b> into the present structure: a massive fortification of granite extending around<ins> 5 km (3.1 mi)</ins> in circumference. It remained the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty until <b>1590 </b>when the capital was shifted to Hyderabad. The Qutb Shahis expanded the fort, whose<ins> 7 km (4.3 mi)</ins> outer wall enclosed the city.</p>

<p>Golconda fort is listed as an archaeological treasure on the official "List of Monuments" prepared by the <mark>Archaeological Survey of India</mark> under The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act.[14] Golconda consists of four distinct forts with a<u> 10 km (6.2 mi)</u> long outer wall with 87 semicircular bastions (some still mounted with cannons), eight gateways, and four drawbridges, with a number of royal apartments and halls, temples, mosques, magazines, stables, etc. inside. The lowest of these is the outermost enclosure entered by the "Fateh Darwaza" (Victory gate, so called after Aurangzeb’s triumphant army marched in through this gate) studded with giant iron spikes (to prevent elephants from battering them down) near the south-eastern corner. An acoustic effect can be experienced at Fateh Darwazaan, a hand clap at a certain point below the dome at the entrance reverberates and can be heard clearly at the<b> 'Bala Hisar' </b>pavilion, the highest point almost a kilometer away. This worked as a warning in case of an attack.</p>
